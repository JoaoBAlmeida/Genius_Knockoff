# Genius_Knockoff
Code written for programmable logic device's class
(VHDL for FPGA)
Through 4 led's, a sequence will be presented to the player. If he can press (through the 4 buttons presented) the order in wich the leds turned on, the game will progress to harder difficulties and more of the player's memory will be used.
The idea of this little project is to show our capacity to implement knowledge acquired through class, from basic code structure/writting in VHDL, to implementation of machine state, clock control, package usage and others.
